Human's confidence is a interesting thing. It drives them to argue with anyone on anything.

The young man called wcy must be ridiculous back to his undergraduate period. He never knows what reminds him of a mid-term exam of discrete mathematics, where he argued with his teacher, one of the worst teacher who taught this class, on the result of a simple question. At that exam, He didn't use the simple solution, which could be easily found on the slides or textbooks for a hard-working student. But he tried to figure out he was right. The atomsphere was quite a mass. Fortunately the teacher admitted the aweful solution and gave him 5 points back. Significant points, without that there would be a great fall in his GPA.

Now he is absent-minded during his workday as a graduated student. Wish nothing but the best for him.
